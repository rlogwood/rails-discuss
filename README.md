This is a repository to share and discuss rails examples


### Getting Started With Rails

- _If you alreay have your Rails environment setup, you may enjoy the clear error reporting from the BetterErrors gem:
https://github.com/BetterErrors/better_errors._ :sunglasses:

### Getting your environment setup
- Getting your environment setup can be painful IMO. I finally settled on Linux primarily 
and use **brew** to install **chruby** and **ruby-install** for managing my ruby versions. 

- I'm currently using Linux, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

- If you're starting out can avoid a lot of headaches by following the exact instructions 
in a tutorial for their environment (exact version of rails, ruby, node). 

- For javascript modules (for example webpacker) you'll need to have **node** setup also and I use **yarn** for 
javascript package installs (there may other setup issues for python and gcc):

#### Development tools you'll need 
- _NOTE: For mac's use the macOS brew, for window use WSL2 and find a tutorial that is specific to that environment._
- https://github.com/postmodern/chruby
- https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install 
- https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux 
- nvm to manage node versions  - https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nvm  (**pyenv** for python versions)
- yarn to manage javascript packages - https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/yarn
- `nvm --help`  use it to install *node*
- some tutorials let you avoid setup by using a pre-configured online environment until you get your own setup :service_dog: :slightly_smiling_face:

### Reading the Rails docs, invaluable IMO: :monocle_face:
- https://guides.rubyonrails.org/
- https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/ (these are often more up to date)
- https://apidock.com/
- Rails source code https://github.com/rails
